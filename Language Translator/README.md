# Language Translator with Generative AI
This project implements a generative AI application for language translation, utilizing FastAPI for backend endpoints and Streamlit for the frontend UI. The application allows users to specify the target language and input text for translation.

# Technologies Used:
FastAPI: Python web framework for building APIs with fast performance.
Streamlit: Python library for creating interactive web apps for machine learning and data science.
Generative AI: Utilized for language translation using advanced machine learning models.

# Features:
Translation Endpoint: Accepts requests to translate text into specified languages.
Interactive UI: Streamlit-based frontend provides a user-friendly interface for translation input and display.

# Installation:
